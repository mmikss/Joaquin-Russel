        <h1>Happy 17th Birthday, Russel!</h1>
        <p>Today marks another year of your beautiful existance, and though I wish I could be there to celebrate with you, my heart is wrapped around yours, no matter the miles between us. Seventeen years ago, the world became brighter because you were born. And somewhere along the way, fate brought us together, proving that love knows no distance. Every day, I am grateful for you-your kindness, your laughter, and the way you make my heart feel full even miles away. I hope today brings you as much joy as you have given me. I wish I could hold your hand, see your smile in person, and whisper how much I adore you. But until that day comes, know that I am loving you from afar, counting down the moments until I can finally be in your arms. Happy Birthday, My Baby. You are my forever, my always, my sweetest hello and my hardest goodbye. I love you endlessly. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
